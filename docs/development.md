# Development and publication

Read [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) and [contributing](../CONTRIBUTING.md). This workflow
follows Irreducible's branch, checkpoint, review and verified-cleanup principles;
its native-engine CI matrix is not required for this experiment workspace.

## Checks

```sh
uv sync --frozen
uv run python scripts/check_repository.py
uv run python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

CI runs the packet/storage/link checks and consumer tests on Python 3.11 and 3.13
for PRs targeting `main`, pushes to `main`, and manual runs. It does not download
scientific data or rebuild Irreducible. Runner tests challenge admission,
source/receipt identity, failure retention and path handling using a test engine.
For a consumer change also exercise a real clean, pinned Irreducible binary and
inspect its gates. Use the example command in the README. Plot changes need an
actual render and visual inspection. Documentation changes need truthful examples
and valid local links, not a full scientific campaign.

## PRs

Agents use `codex/` branches. Preserve unrelated changes, stage coherent explicit
paths, review the staged diff, commit useful checkpoints and push them promptly
when authorized. A coupled redesign can be substantial; unrelated work belongs
in another PR. Explain dependencies on Prospector/Irreducible revisions and test
the integrated candidate after a dependency changes. Open a PR and report checks
and limitations accurately. Attach created PRs to the Codex chat.

The owner gives standing authorization for agents to review their own PRs and
merge ready changes without asking again. Do a deliberate review pass over the
complete final diff, fix actionable findings, resolve conversations and require
applicable green checks on the latest integrated head and up-to-date base.
No separate human reviewer is required. Record the review conclusion and actual
checks. Use a merge commit and verify the exact head before merging; perform the
merge directly once ready rather than relying on GitHub's auto-merge setting.
Direct `main` pushes, force pushes and wiki/external messages still require
specific authorization. Scientific qualification remains a separate gate.

## After an authorized merge

Verify the PR state, exact head and merge SHA with GitHub. Wait for post-merge CI
on that exact `main` commit. Inspect status/worktrees, fetch/prune, prove local
`main` is an ancestor of `origin/main`, then update it fast-forward-only. Before
`git branch -d`, prove the feature tip equals the verified PR head and is an
ancestor of fetched `origin/main`. Preserve dirty checkouts, extra commits and
branches used by active worktrees; never use force deletion. Remote branch
deletion is separate and depends on repository settings. Report deferred cleanup.

If `main` fails, stop new merges, preserve logs and fix or revert through a PR
under the same review and fresh-check gates. Do not bypass the failure or weaken
tests merely to make the status green.

The LCDM native controller requires a real installed clean, pinned SDK and exact
released input identities for scientific execution. Lightweight CI tests its
adversarial admission, failure retention, bounds and comparison gates without
scientific data or a native rebuild. A real run and deliberate source/reference
review are additionally required; record their identities in the packet history.
Cross-project owners coordinate dependencies before merging, and rerun the
integrated consumer when a pinned interface changes. Documentation-only engine
commits do not implicitly update a packet's scientific SDK pin.

The [thermal DESI campaign consumer](../experiments/lcdm-campaign/README.md)
separates a clean pinned source checkout from the read-only build artifacts when
the engine owner's primary checkout advances. Verify both identities and all
manifest source hashes; copying a source revision label does not verify an
archive. Its full-model packet stays blocked while named conditional controls
run through the bounded controller. Preserve original partial/failure output,
test admission adversarially, and review a fresh committed run before reporting
numerical acceptance. The campaign records readiness and findings for the
[sole local roadmap](roadmap.md); its historical campaign.json does not schedule
current work or execute commands from JSON. [Current gaps](gaps.md) is an evidence
inventory, not a second queue.

The [SDSS source reader](../experiments/sdss-released-observer-contract/README.md)
has a dedicated structural route with no engine request. Review its exact
schemas and source joins, run adversarial fixtures and a fresh committed source
attempt, and retain failures and changed-file identities. Structural completion
does not unblock the scientific packet or the released likelihood.

The [released finite-box controller](../experiments/released-box/README.md)
has a distinct SDK/request identity and an immutable original contract snapshot.
Test complete and partial native admission, exact support/source/order identity,
total numerical-budget accounting and failure retention. Review original-input
reference ancestry and earned errors, then perform a fresh committed bounded
original46 attempt. Native conditional enclosures and empirical reference
comparisons do not close the source/physical qualification gaps.
